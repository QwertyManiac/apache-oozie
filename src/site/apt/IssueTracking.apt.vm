Apache Oozie(TM) Issue Tracking System

  Apache Oozie tracks both bugs and enhancement requests {{{http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OOZIE}here}} using
  Apache JIRA. We welcome input, however, <<before filing a request>>, please make sure you do the following:

  * Search the JIRA database.

  * Check the oozie-users {{{./MailingLists.html}mailing list}}, both by searching the archives and by asking questions.
